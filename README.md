Learning representations, clustering and predicting urban perception from urban data. 

The main objective of this study is to learn embeddings based on OpenStreetMap data,
using urban hexagonal microregions as the unit of analysis, with the aim of evaluating their
ability to abstract and detect urban patterns through clustering algorithms in the Metropolitan
Region of Santiago, Chile. Additionally, it seeks to assess whether embedding methods, such
as Hex2Vec, are effective in predicting visual features associated with urban perception.
